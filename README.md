# Appcelerator-Modules

This project is intended only to give track of common issues I've found or either some "Needs" I actually feel the absurd necesity of solving, if you like them well... you can have them i dont really care of the usage if it manage to help someone else

Also, if you use any of them please be cool and give some credits on it since im just making small workarrounds to avoid the excesive usage of code and well avoid using widgets which may or may not work, so I'll update this as i get it going.

Cheers and good luck on your road through appcelerator!
